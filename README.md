# 🥁 DrumKit - JavaScript Practice Project

This is a simple **DrumKit project** I built while practicing **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.  
You can play drum sounds using your **keyboard, mouse, or touch** (mobile-friendly). The active key highlights with a visual effect when pressed.

## 🚀 Features
- Play drum sounds using **keyboard keys**.
- **Mouse click & touch support** for mobile and desktop users.
- Visual animation when a key is pressed.
- Smooth transition effect handled with `transitionend`.
- Resetting audio playback (`audio.currentTime = 0`) to allow rapid repeated sounds.

While making this project, I learned:
- How to use **JavaScript event listeners** like `keydown`, `click`, `touchstart`, and `transitionend`.
- How to connect **keyboard key codes** with corresponding sounds and UI elements.
- How to control **HTML5 audio elements** (`play()`, `currentTime`).
- How to add and remove CSS classes dynamically with `classList`.
- How to make web projects **mobile-friendly** with touch interactions.
- The importance of writing clean, reusable functions.
